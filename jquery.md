## Getting Started: FAQs

Before we can learn jQuery, we must understand what it is, how we will use it, and what we can expect to learn from this guide. 

### What is jQuery?
[jQuery][jquery] is a small, simple client-side JavaScript web framework that is used by 60% of the internet's top websites.

### What is jQuery used for?
Web developers use jQuery for a variety of things, anywhere from traversing and manipulating the DOM (e.g. changing text on a page without reloading it), event handling (responding to button clicks or form submissions on the client-side), and making HTTP requests (posting information to a backend). Essentially, jQuery is useful in making "single-page web applications," applications which load a page once and do everything else from inside the browser.

### What will this tutorial teach me?
This tutorial is not meant to serve as a more formal introduction to JavaScript or jQuery. It is meant to teach only the basics of this incredibly feature-rich library, and shows only some of the things that the framework can be used for.

## Using this Document

This document contains a series of several sections, each of which explains a certain feature of jQuery that is valuable in building web applications. All of the code referenced inside the guide will be available on Github. 

### Running the Sample Code

Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript runs in the browser. This means that JavaScript code does not need to be compiled, and is instead run through within HTML. 

Therefore, to run the sample code, one must merely open the provided HTML files in her browser of choice (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
